# üíº AutoJob.ai ‚Äì Workday Job Application Automation

## üß† How It Works

1. Launches the job URL
2. Clicks `Apply`, then selects `Apply Manually`
3. Iteratively:
   - Extracts the current form page
   - Matches extracted fields with `form_config.yaml`
   - Autofills and submits
4. Completes the job application automatically
